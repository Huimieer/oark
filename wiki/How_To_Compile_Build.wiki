#summary How To Compile Build

= Introduction =

To build/compile oark is necessary the Visual Studio (we are using the 2008 version). Build *ALWAYS* first the driver, and after the User Mode project, it needs the driver to compile:

*To build the driver* you need the *DDKWIZARD, the WINDDK (we are using WinDDK 6001.17121) and the DDKBUILDCMD:*  View this page to know how it works, installation etc.: [http://code.google.com/p/oark/wiki/Developers_Guide#Environment_for_Developers]

  * *oark driver*, we recommend use *WXP Free*:
    * From *Visual Studio GUI:* open the oark_driver.sln, select if you want a WXP Free or WXP Checked, and click in Build in the top of window and after: Build Solution.
    * From *Command line:* 
      # Set variables: *set WXPBASE=C:\WinDDK\6001.17121*
      # Build the driver (you can use -WXP checked instead -WXP free): *c:\WinDDK\ddkbuild.cmd  -WXP free "C:\oark\oark_driver\oark_driver"*
      # Run the Postbuild script (this script copy the driver to user mode folder): *"C:\oark\oark_driver\oark_driver\ddkpostbld.cmd"*

  * *oark usermode*, we recommend use *Release*:
      * From *Visual Studio GUI:* open the oark_usermode.sln, select if you want a Release or Debug Build, and click in Build in the top of window and after: Build Solution.
      * From *Visual Studio Command line:* Using the Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt: *cmd.exe /k "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86*
        * Release: C:\oark\oark_usermode>*msbuild /p:configuration=Release oark_usermode.sln*
        * Debug: C:\oark\oark_usermode>*msbuild /p:configuration=Debug oark_usermode.sln*

After this. The *oark.exe* is in the *oark\Release* directory. The executable have inside the driver.
